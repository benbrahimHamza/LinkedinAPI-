### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name's Hamza
#### I am a Software Engineer living in Aix-en-Provence.
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to extract your information from LinkedIn if you ever need it for your personal website or for educational purposes.
I am using PHP, Docker, Postgres and Symfony, I do store some info for convenience (use offline) and have some caching capabilities.

Skills: API Platform / PHP / Symfony 5.2 / Docker

- Feel free to use according to LinkedIn's terms of use and mine too (Just a shoutout would be fine)
- Also, improvements are welcome, just use GitHub's fancy dandy Pull Requests, I'll check them out whenever I have some time.
